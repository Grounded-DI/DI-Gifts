# ðŸ§  Scroll Logic Execution (Explained)

Logic Runner Lite is built to simulate deterministic logic chains.

Each response follows:
1. Input Breakdown
2. Logic Tree Execution (scroll-aligned)
3. Fixed Output Structure
4. Entropy Dampening Layer (optional)

All logic maps trace back to Grounded DI authorship chain.

Logic Runner and associated agents are Patent Pending.
